Here's my entry, based on dueling, and the "seconds" that sometimes accompany the combatants. Click to start the game, and swipe to the right to fire once given the signal. <br />

It's definitely more fun to play on a tablet, but since I'm using the always-awesome <a href="http://www.haxe.org" target="_blank">HaXe</a>, it was easy to create the SWF below, in addition to an iOS tablet app.
