<p>
This was a prototype content aggregation system which we demoed at SIGGRAPH 2016 as part of the VR Village, and was created along with Blair Erickson, Stephanie Riggs, and Bill Booth. I was responsible for the C++ implementation of the system within the Unreal engine.  
</p>

<h2>How it works</h2>

<p>
The system supported a number of different types of content, including:

<ul>
<li>static images</li>
<li>2d video</li>
<li>3d video</li>
<li>360 degree video</li>
<li>3d 360 degree video</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>Each piece of content is loaded onto its own piece of geometry and positioned relative to one of several walls. The system by which that happens borrows a page from <a href="http://getbootstrap.com/">bootstrap</a> in that each of the walls spans a 12x9 virtual grid. Assigning a given piece of content to a given wall requires specifying a pair of coordinates for the top-left as well as a number of grid units for the width and the height. 
</p>

<p>
So, the call to send a given piece of content to fill the front wall looks like:

<pre>
content->SetPosition(0, 0, 12, 9);
</pre>

...making it really easy to throw content onto various walls of the space at various locations and sizes. 
</p>

<p>
There are also two special case options for screens: 

<ul>
<li>a large, partially rounded, IMAX-like display</li>
<li>a full sphere suitable for 360 degree videos</li>
</ul>

Both of those options are displayed at a single location, and only one of them can be displayed at a time.
</p>

<p>
Once we had all of that working, we implemented a number of different use cases, all tied to what a Reddit or Facebook (or similar) experience might look like in VR, as well as a menu system to choose between the different experiences.
