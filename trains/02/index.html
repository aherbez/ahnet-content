                    Broken, but with lots of progress. Working on building up a system for creating details by annotating edges. Things that should break through walls like doors and windows are "features" and run for a certain length along the perimeter of a polygon. The polygon then provides a list of edges which are in turn used to create extruded geometry.

                <p>
                    Shown here is the result of chopping one door and one window into the base polygon. Definitely numerous problems, but it's definitely progress.

                    Just getting started. Working on roughing out the base train car shape and adding interior walls. What's shown here is a passenger car consisting of separate cabins (rotated on its side for easier viewing).

                <ul>
                    <li>Created base 2d polygon class</li>
                    <li>Added ExtrudedGeometry class</li>
                    <li>added ability to grow/shrink polygons</li>
                    <li>added ability to extrude a polygon</li>
                    <li>added ability to extrude a polygon as a shell of a given thickness</li>
                    <li>added ability to cut a polygon with a line</li>
