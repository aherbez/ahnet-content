<h1>Class Overview</h1>

<p>Welcome! In this class, we will be covering the basics of the C++ programming language.</p>

<p>C++ is one of the most powerful and widely-used languages out there, and is used pretty much anywhere a computer is found</p>

<p>Each week, we'll cover a new set of topics releated to C++. Weekly assignments will be given in which you will have a chance to practice the concepts we discuss in class. I'll also be giving short quizzes to help keep previous topics fresh.</p>

<h2>Makeup of your final grade</h2>

<p>Your final grade will consist of the following:

<table class="table">
<thead>
<td>Source</td>
<td>% of Final</td>
</thead>
<tr>
<td>Quizzes</td>
<td>5%</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Assignments</td>
<td>60%</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Midterm</td>
<td>15%</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Final</td>
<td>20%</td>
</tr>
</table>

More on each of the above follows below.</p>

<h3>Quizzes</h3>

<p>Most classes will begin with a short quiz covering previous topics. These will not be hard, and are meant mainly as a way to keep the content from previous classs fresh in your mind. When calculating your quiz score, I will discard two of your lowest scoring quizzes (one from the first half of the semester, and one from the second half).</p>

<h3>Assignments</h3>

<p>Each week, you will be presented with an assignment consisting of one or more programming challenges. You are to write code to complete the challenges, and submit the files to me no later than the start of the following class</p>

<p>Any submissions received later than the start of the next class (3:30pm, PST, the Friday following the one in which the assignment was first discussed), will be considered late, and will receive a penalty to the grade they earn.</p>

<h4>Submitting assignments</h4>

<p>Assignments should be placed in a folder, and that folder should be compressed to a single .ZIP file. The filename for the ZIP should include:
<ul>
<li>Your last name</li>
<li>The assignment number</li>
</ul>

So, if I was going to submit my work for week 1, I would email (myself) a zip file named "Herbez_week1.zip"</p>

<p>If you have reason to submit more than once, please include a further number in the file name. So, if I had realized I had forgotten a file in the above submission, I would name the next zip "Herbez_week1_2.zip"</p>


<h3>The Midterm</h3>

<p>The midterm will be similar to the assignments, but slightly larger in scope. I will be giving you a list of problems to solve, and expecting you to select a few from the list to implement.</p>

<p>The midterm will be submitted in the same way as the assignments- as a ZIP file emailed to me at aherbez@gmail.com</p>

<p>More on the midterm as we get closer</p>


<h3>Final Projects</h3>

<p>The class will end with you creating a project of your own choosing. Don't worry if you're not sure what to do just yet- I will be working with you as the semester progresses to help you pick a project that is both challenging enough for you to learn on, while not being too large to fit into a few weeks of work. </p>

<h2>Plagarism</h2>

<p>You <em>MAY NOT</em>:
<ul>
<li>Copy &amp; Paste code you find on the internet for use in your projects.</li>
<li>Use code you download from the internet.</li>
<li>Use any code from another student.</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>You <em>MAY</em>:
<ul>
<li>Use code from YOUR OWN previous projects.</li>
<li>Look at code on the internet to get an idea of how to implement something.</li>
<li>Use code snippets from the module lessons and demos (though I would suggest making your own version)</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>It is never, ever okay to directly use &amp; apply code from the internet or other students on assignments.  At a real game company, that would likely be plagiarism (depending on the license) and could kill the company if the original author got wind of it.
