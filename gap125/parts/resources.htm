<h1>Resources</h1>

<p>This section will provide various resouces to help you learn C++. This section will be added to regularly over the course of the semester.</p>

<h2>General Help</h2>

<p>Learning C++ is a challenging task, and can often be hard. If you ever need help, feel free to ask me in class, or to email me at <span>aherbez</span><span>@</span><span>gmail.com</span>.</p>

<p>The other main resource for getting help is the AAU Slack channel. You should have received information about how to access that, but let me know if you haven't. I will be online there most of the time, as will other faculty members and your fellow students.</p>

<h2>Books</h2>

<p>While there is no <em>required</em> textbook for this class, it is strongly recommended that you get a copy of 
<a href="http://smile.amazon.com/Programming-Principles-Practice-Using-2nd/dp/0321992784/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1454636559&sr=1-1&keywords=bjarne+stroustrup">Programming: Principles and Practice Using C++ (2nd edition) by Bjarne Stroustrup</a>. It's an excellent introductory textbook, written by the creator of the language himself.</p>


<h2>Tools</h2>

<p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.visualstudio.com/">Visual Studio</a>: This is the IDE (Integrated Development Environment) that we'll be using in the class. The community editon has everything we need, and can be downloaded for free</li>
</ul>
</p>


<h2>Websites</h2>

<h3>References</h3>

<p>This section has various sites that provide good references and info on the C++ language</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.cplusplus.com/">cplusplus.com</a>: A great site with a <em>TON</em> of info. Not something to sit down and read, since it can be like drinking from a firehose, but this is a great go-to to look up information on a specific function or language feature</li>
</ul>


<h3>Ways to practice</h3>

<p>In order to become a good programmer, you'll need to practice. Here are some great sites for honing your skills</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.hackerrank.com">Hackerrank</a>: Provides tons of coding challenges that can be solved in a variety of languages, including C++. They also run regular time-limited contests, which can be a lot of fun.</li>
<li><a href="https://codefights.com/">Codefights</a>: Site that hosts both daily challenges and timed competitions against bots. Many of the bots are sponsored by tech companies, and provide challenges related to what those companies do.</li>
<li><a href="http://adventofcode.com/">Advent of Code</a>: A short collection of Christmas-themed coding challenges that walk you through repairing Santa's weather machine.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/dailyprogrammer">the dailyprogrammer subreddit</a>: This sub posts programming challenges every few days (several a week), each marked as easy, intermediate, or hard</li>
<li><a href="http://www.indiegamejams.com/">Indie Game Jams</a>: GameJams are a <em>GREAT</em> way to build up your gamedev chops, and there's almost always one in progress or coming up. This site is a handy (and extensive) calendar of gamejams.</li>
<li><a href="http://rosalind.info/">Rosalind</a>: This is actually a site about teaching bioinformatics (the sub-domain of computer science related to solving problems in biology, such as sequencing the genome), but it does that by providing programming challenges that can be solved using the lanugage of your choice. Note that the problems get pretty sophisticated here, but there are quite a few that are simple. As a bonus, each comes with a bit of biology information to set the stage</li>
</ul>

<h2>Fun Stuff</h2>

<p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-vcErOPofQ&ab_channel=TheLazlo101">Grace Hopper on David Letterman</a>: Grace Hopper invented the compiler, and is the reason we all get to write code that's at least reasonably close to normal language, rather than just machine code. She was also an amazing speaker and educator, and this clip of her on David Letterman is pure gold.</li> 
</ul>
