that squirt
you shouldn't throw off a building
grownups wish they could still do
you shouldn't do In public
you shouldn't play catch with
that go bad
you shouldn't lick
you should lick
you would rather forget
you wish you could remember
you shouldn't swallow
that jiggle
you wouldn't do for a million dollars
you would do for a million dollars
your parents forgot to tell you
you don't want to find in your bed
people do when no one is looking
cannibals think about while dining
that are harder than they look
you shouldn't say to your in-laws
you would do if you were a giant
you shouldn't tie to the roof of your car
not to tell your mother
dogs are actually saying when they bark
you can never find
wouldn't want to be allergic to
that make you uncomfortable
you wouldn't want to do in cemetery
things that would be fun to do in an elevator
not to do in a hospital
never put in your mouth
that smell terrible
your parents would kill you for
you shouldn't say when trying to make a good impression
things you shouldn't wear to a wedding/funeral
you shouldn't attempt to juggle
you shouldn't do when naked
that confirm your life is going downhill
things that would keep you out of heaven
that would send you straight to hell
that shouldn't be passed from one generation to the next
things paramedics shouldn't say to a patient on the way to the hospital
you would ask a psychic
you shouldn't do with glue
you might find in a library
your grandmother always said
that you can trip over
that you would like to do in an airplane bathroom
that must be magic
that you shouldn't play catch with
that go bad
paramedics shouldn't say to a patient on the way to the hospital
