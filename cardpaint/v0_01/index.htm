<h2>Cardboard Paint v0.1</h1>
This is a small demo using javascript composite modes to allow the user to draw with 3d cardboard. 
Cardboard is simulated by layering two images with a slight offset- one for the interior of the cardboard, and one for the exterior. 
<br /><br />
Click and drag the mouse to draw. Spacebar will toggle between drawing and erasing. 

<br /><br />
This is the beginning of what will hopefully grow to be a more fully-featured app, once I've cleaned up the code and added a few more features. Watch this space!
