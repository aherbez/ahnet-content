<h1>Drunk Robots 01: First Prototype</h1>

This is the first of (hopefully) a series of popup papercraft kits. This is the image that I'll be building into the mechanism:

<br /><br />
I've just finished off the design and construction (via Maya, Pepakura Designer, and Illustrator) of the first pass of the kit, with the following results:

<table cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" border="0">
<tr>
<td><img src="proto01_1.jpg" /></td>
<td><img src="proto01_2.jpg" /></td>
</tr>
</table>
</center>
<br /><br />
There's a pull tab on the bottom of the box (outside the shot). Pulling on that causes the level of the bot's drink to lower, and a mechanical broken heart to rise behind him.
It still needs some work, as the heart doesn't rise quite enough yet. Also, the design could be simplified a bit to make it easier for others to assemble. This is just v1.
<br />
More to come soon...
