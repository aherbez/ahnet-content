            <h1>GLFlowers v0.02: Better Leaves</h1>

            <p>
                v0.02: Big update to leaf geometry generation, with curvature along all three axes.
            </p>

            <p>
                v0.01: Rough cut of the basic scene and model hierarchy. Notable files as follows:
            </p>

            <p><strong>Scene:</strong> sets up a WebGL context.</p>

            <p><strong>DynamicModel:</strong> base class for a "dynamic" model which in this case means a model with procedurally generated geometry. The random generation is based on a given seed value, so can be persistent if that's what you want</p>

            <p><strong>Petal:</strong> A sub-class of DynamicModel that generates a leaf-shaped mesh and colors it from red to green away from the spine. </p>

            <p><strong>Curves</strong> Implements Bezier curves, both quadratic and cubic (two cubic curves are the basis for the shape of each leaf)</p>

            <p><strong>rand</strong> Implements a linear congruental random number generator with the ability to set a given seed</p>
