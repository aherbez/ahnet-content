            <h1>GLFlowers v0.03: Leaves and Stems</h1>

            <p>
                v0.03: Adding leaves to the stem, plus laying the groundwork for lighting.
            </p>

            <p>
                v0.02: Big update to leaf geometry generation, with curvature along all three axes.
            </p>

            <p>
                v0.01: Rough cut of the basic scene and model hierarchy. 
            </p>

            <li><strong>Scene:</strong> sets up a WebGL context.</li>

            <li><strong>DynamicModel:</strong> base class for a "dynamic" model which in this case means a model with procedurally generated geometry. The random generation is based on a given seed value, so can be persistent if that's what you want</li>

            <li><strong>Petal:</strong> A sub-class of DynamicModel that generates a leaf-shaped mesh and colors it from red to green away from the spine. </li>

            <li><strong>Curves</strong> Implements Bezier curves, both quadratic and cubic (two cubic curves are the basis for the shape of each leaf)</li>

            <li><strong>rand</strong> Implements a linear congruental random number generator with the ability to set a given seed</li>
