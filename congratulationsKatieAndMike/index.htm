<h1>Congratulations!</h1>

Congratulations to both of you, and thanks so much for inviting us to be a part of your special day. We may have missed our chance to snap a photo for the book with the camera, but that won't stop us. <br /><br />

Right-click on the photo and choose "Save As..." to grab the photo. <br /><br />
