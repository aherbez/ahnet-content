<h1>Experimental Activity: Class 05</h1>

<p>
In this class, we'll be looking at uploading images from Flash, storing them in a database table, and retrieving them in a simple gallery.
</p>

<p>
The example below consists of two parts: one to upload images to a database table on my site, and the other to display all of the images so uploaded. They could certainly be combined in a single project- I've just separated them out for clarity.
</p>


<h2>Example 1: upload</h2>
<embed src="class09.swf" width="500" height="400" />

<h2>Example 2: gallery</h2>
<embed src="class09gallery.swf" width="500" height="400" />


<h2>Flash Files</h2>
<ul>
<li><a href="class09.as">class09.as</a> main document class for upload example</li>
<li><a href="ImageUpload.as">ImageUpload.as</a> class to handle the image uploading</li>
<li><a href="ImageGallery.as">ImageGallery.as</a> class to handle the display of images</li>
</ul>
<h2>PHP files</h2>
<ul>
<li><a href="insert_image_php.txt">insert_image.php</a> PHP file responsible for storing an image in the database</li>
<li><a href="list_images_php.txt">list_images.php</a> PHP file that lists all of the images in the database</li>
<li><a href="image_xml_php.txt">image_xml.php</a> PHP file that outputs an XML document of all the images in the database</li>
<li><a href="show_image_php.txt">show_image.php</a> PHP file that outputs a single image as a JPGE</li>
</ul>
