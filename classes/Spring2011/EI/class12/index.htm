<h1>Experimental Activity: Class 12</h1>

<p>
In this class, we'll be covering the basics of using the Facebook PHP SDK to access information about a user, in order to build more social applications. This week, we'll just be looking at the FB/PHP side of things- we'll incorporate it all into Flash in next week's class
</p>

<h2>Example</h2>

The demo for this class will load info from Facebook to retrieve: 

<ul>
<li>Your name and profile picture</li>
<li>Any and all bands that you have "liked"</li>
<li>The 5 most recent posts by your friends</li>
</ul>

<p>To see it in action, click <a href="get_fb_data.php">here</a></p>

<h2>Class files</h2>

Just one this week:
<ul>
<li><a href="get_fb_data_php.txt">get_fb_data.php</a></li>
</ul>

You'll also need the facebook PHP sdk, which can be downloaded from <a href="https://github.com/facebook/php-sdk/">here</a>
