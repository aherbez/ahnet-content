        <h2>Introducing Corona</h2>
        
        Corona is a powerful and easy-to-use tool for developing games and applications for mobile devices using the Lua programming language. Corona can be used to develop for both iOS (iPhone, iPad, and iPod touch) and Android devices.

        <h2>Introducing Lua</h2>
        <p>
        Lua is a lightweight scripting language that is used by a number of applications and games, and is the language used with Corona. It definitely has its quirks, but it's easy to pick up and easy to work with, and is <strong>much</strong> nicer than say, Objective-C (the language used for iPhone development).

        <h2>Example game</h2>
        
        <p>In the example game, the objective is to fire a cannonball at a target. When the target is hit, it falls down and a new target appears in a new location.</p>
        
        <p>The game is simple, but demonstrates the following
        <ul>
            <li>Loading images</li>
            <li>Using display groups</li>
            <li>Working with Corona's built-in physics library</li>
            <li>Collision detection</li>
        </ul>
        </p>
