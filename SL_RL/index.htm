<h1>SecondLife -> Real Life</h1>

Here's an example of the kind of thing that becomes possible by combining ogle with pepakura designer (with some necessary cleanup in between in Maya).

<br><br>
A Second-Life vehicle (the unibike by Chandra Page) was captured using ogle, cleaned up (and simplified/rebuilt a bit) in Maya, and then unwrapped with pepakura designer. The end result is a pattern that can be printed out on cardstock and built into a real-world version of the object.
<br><br>
While the unibike ended up being a bit involved to build, simpler models might make great (and cheap) promotional items. We could give away paper versions of popular resident-created objects/buildings that could be assembled into desktop versions, thereby bringing the Second Life building experience into the real world.
<br><br>
Just something to think about- here are a couple of additional photos.
